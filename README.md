- Manages game states: countdown, gameplay, and game over
- Handles apple spawning with configurable intervals
- Controls UI updates for score and timer
- Manages scene transitions and score persistence

### GameOver.cs

### AppleRotation.cs
- Controls the 3D apple model rotation in the game over screen
- Provides smooth continuous rotation using `Time.deltaTime`

## ðŸŽ¯ Game Flow
